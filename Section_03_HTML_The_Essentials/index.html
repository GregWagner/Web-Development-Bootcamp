      The <strong>chicken</strong> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of
      domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus).
      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19
      billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other
      bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source
      of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.

      Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
      were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries
      BC).[3][4] Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in
      South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but with the clade found in
      the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian
      subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia
      in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had
      been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that
      gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria
      and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]
